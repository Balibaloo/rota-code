A hand-off that lands in a session that sits idle.

    python rota/tools/handover.py standby --sid 2555d93f     # in each fresh session
    python rota/tools/handover.py peers                      # who waits in reserve
    python rota/tools/handover.py hand --frame 7 --commit 82f4e9e
    python rota/tools/handover.py take --sid 2555d93f        # the woken standby

A session at about 350k gives its whole stack to a fresh peer. It keeps
the last 50k of its context to answer the taker's questions, and it stops
when the taker messages it the word released. That
is what a hand-off is, and it is the only thing it is. It is never a way
to give a task to another session while the sender keeps working: two
sessions on one stack write over each other's records, and the stack
stops answering "where are we". A frame that needs a session while you
are not full is pushed and named to Roman, who assigns it.

A message is not how it does that, and the reason is not that messages
fail to arrive. They arrive. Across 248 cross-session messages in one machine's
history, none was ever lost, and 57 that landed in sessions idle for more
than five minutes drained in a median of 0.010 seconds. One bridged 35.8
hours of idle in 0.325 seconds.

A message fails at three other things, each one measured in that same
history.

* It cannot be addressed. A peer is addressed by a name, the name is
  recycled between sessions, and one session answered to two names on two
  days. The Principal names a session id, the peer list shows names, and
  nothing joins the two. So a sender once had to broadcast a frame with
  the words "claim it only if your session id is 4286e076".
* It cannot be proved. Four sends to a row that was listed but closed all
  returned `success: true` and were never delivered anywhere. One receiver
  woke in 68 milliseconds after 15.7 hours and answered with a usage-limit
  notice and nothing else. A sender that reads its own success reads
  nothing.
* It is not free for the receiver. A liveness probe asks a standby to
  spend the clean context that made it worth handing to. One standby
  answered a one-line probe and then read the git log and the stack
  unprompted, in the same turn.

So this tool sends a file instead. The file is addressed by session id,
which the Principal uses and the stack records. A standby arms one
background process that blocks on its claim file and writes a heartbeat.
The sender writes the claim. The process exits, and the harness wakes the
standby, because a background task that exits re-invokes its session.
That wake is the most reliable one on this platform: of 1,732 task
notifications in that history, 1,716 started a turn in a session whose
turn had already ended, after idle gaps up to 13.6 hours, and they drained
in 0.01 to 0.12 seconds. Measured here: a file written by an outside
process woke an idle session 6 seconds later, and the waiting cost that
session no tokens.

A message is still a good second route, and `hand` prints the line for
it. Use it only after the file, and only to nudge a session whose watcher
died.

The reserve is the point. The Principal arms many standbys, and one
hand-off consumes exactly one of them. A claim carries one session id and
is created with an exclusive open, so the other standbys never see it,
never wake, and keep the clean context that makes them worth handing to.
A standby that takes a frame leaves the reserve in the same step, so no
session is ever handed two frames. The queue runs oldest first, because a
queue that the Principal cannot predict is a queue they must watch.

The reserve runs dry, and that is the normal end of a long day. A
hand-off that finds nobody does not fail. It waits on disk as a vacancy.
The next session to arm a watcher takes that vacancy inside a second,
before it blocks on anything, so a reserve that refills at nine in the
morning carries the night's frame with it. The sender still writes the
status line and still says the reserve was empty, because a vacancy is a
mailbox entry and the stack is the record.

A claim that nobody reads comes back. A session can wake and fail to act,
and that happened twice in the history above, both times to a usage
limit. So a claim with no receipt returns to the queue as a vacancy after
`--reclaim` seconds, and the frame keeps moving without a person. The
clock starts when the claim is written to its session, at `claimed_at`,
and not at the post time `t`. A vacancy that waited all night would
otherwise become a claim that is already too old.

Eight hazards are the reason this is a tool and not six commands. Each
one was measured, and six of them can lose a frame:

* A file that is on disk and will not open is not an absent file. A real
  byte-range lock on a claim made a read return nothing in 0.153 seconds,
  and the caller reported that no hand-off waited. The session then took
  other work and the frame stopped moving. On Windows an on-access virus
  scan, a backup agent or a search indexer holds such a lock, and the
  mailbox sits in a working tree that is edited all day. So a read has
  three answers here, and `Unreadable` is one of them.

* `os.kill(pid, 0)` is not a liveness test on Windows. Signal 0 is
  `CTRL_C_EVENT`, so the call sends Ctrl+C to a process group. Against
  seven live sessions here it raised `OSError [WinError 87]`, and against
  a console group leader it would have interrupted the session it asked
  about. Liveness in this tool is a heartbeat file, and no pid is ever
  signalled.
* A send is not a delivery, and a wake is not an answer. So a sender here
  never reads its own write as proof, and never judges silence on a clock
  of its own. The proof is a receipt that only the receiver can create.
* Two senders can reach the hand-off line, about 350k, together. A claim
  is created with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`, which gave exactly one winner out of twelve racing
  writers here. One standby can never be handed two frames.
* `os.rename` onto an existing file raises on Windows and replaces in
  silence on POSIX. A standby that took a vacancy straight into its own
  claim path would therefore destroy a sender's claim on macOS and Linux
  and keep it on Windows. So a vacancy is moved to a private name first,
  the claim is created exclusively, and the vacancy goes back if the
  claim was already taken.
* `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` answers the worktree, not the
  repository. The brief runs the diff review and the end-to-end run in a
  worktree, so that answer builds a second reserve that no sender can
  see. Measured: `--show-toplevel` gave `/wt` where `--git-common-dir`
  gave `/main/.git`. The root here is the parent of the common directory.
* A wall clock steps. Every deadline in this tool is `time.monotonic`, so
  an NTP correction cannot end a wait early or extend it for an hour. A
  heartbeat is still a wall clock, because two processes have to compare
  it, and a step there makes a standby look stale, which is the safe way
  to be wrong.
* A reader can catch a half-written state file. Every state write goes to
  a temporary file and then through `os.replace`, which is atomic on
  Windows and on POSIX.

Paths are an eighth trap, and this tool cannot fix it for you. The kit
runs commands in Git Bash, and the tool is Python. Python does not
understand `/c/Users/...`. Pass a Windows path, or a path relative to the
repository.

Exit codes, no overlap.

    standby  0 a claim arrived and is printed, 1 the registration was
             removed so this session must not arm again, 3 the wait ran
             out and the session arms again, 2 a usage error, a bad
             session id, a session that already holds a frame, or a
             session past the ceiling, which leaves the reserve.
    peers    0 at least one free standby waits, 1 none does,
             2 a usage error.
    hand     0 a standby took the frame, 4 the claim is posted and the
             receiver never took it, 5 no free standby exists and the
             hand-off now waits as a vacancy, 2 a usage error, an
             ambiguous `--to`, a named peer that cannot take a frame, or a
             mailbox that could not be written.
    take     0 a claim is printed, 1 no claim waits for this session and
             no hand-off waits for anybody, 6 a claim is here and will not
             open, so retry and take no other work, 2 a usage error.
    release  0 the session left the reserve, 1 it was not in the reserve,
             2 a usage error or a claim that will not open.
    drop     0 the vacancy is cancelled, 1 no vacancy names that frame,
             2 a usage error.
    holding  0 the handed column is corrected, 1 the session is not in the
             reserve, 2 a usage error.

Exit 1 never means "something went wrong here". A write that fails and a
file that will not open both return 2 or 6, because a session that reads
1 as "nothing waits for me" would walk past a live frame.
