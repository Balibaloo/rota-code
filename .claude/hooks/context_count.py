"""UserPromptSubmit hook: inject the session id, a context estimate, and any
hand-off that waits for a session.

The harness sends a JSON object on stdin with session_id and
transcript_path. The hook prints one line of additional context: the
short session id and the tokens in the context window.

It is a count and not an estimate wherever the transcript allows one.
Every assistant turn records its own usage, and the prompt it was given
is the fresh tokens plus the tokens written to cache plus the tokens read
from cache. The hook reads the last of those. No factor, nothing to
calibrate, and a compaction needs no special case, because the turn after
one is given a smaller prompt and says so.

The byte estimate remains as the fallback, for a transcript that carries
no usage. Its factor was 0.6 and is 0.65, measured on 2026-09-20 against
a 4.7 MB transcript whose last turn reported 771,959 tokens. The old
value read 8 percent low. Reading low is the dangerous direction, because
the hand-off refuses to give a frame to a session at or past 300k, and a
session under-reported as 295k is really near 320k. CONTEXT_FACTOR still
overrides it.

When the hook speaks: on the first prompt of a session, so the wake
message can report the count, and on every prompt from 200k upward.
Below 200k after the wake it prints nothing. Set CONTEXT_ALWAYS=1 to
print on every prompt.

The thresholds come from the brief: 200k is the first warning, 300k
takes no new frame, and 350k is the hand-off, with the last 50k kept for
the taker (ruled: Roman, 2026-10-18 02:30).

A compaction is found by parsing each line as JSON and reading its
fields. Matching raw text is wrong: any message that quotes the marker
would reset the count.

The hook also reads `.handover/waiting/`. A hand-off that found no
standby waits there, and `rota/tools/handover.py` gives it to the next
session that arms a watcher. A session that starts for other work arms
nothing, and it would walk past the orphaned frame. So the notice rides
on the prompt that every session sends, and it speaks at any context
count.
