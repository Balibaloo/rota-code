description: Join the reserve and wait for a hand-off, at no cost while waiting
allowed-tools: Bash
---

You are a standby in the reserve. Do these four things, and nothing else.

1. Read your session id from the hook line in this turn. It is the eight
   characters after the word `Session`.
2. Arm one watcher. Use the Bash tool with its background flag and a
   `timeout` of 86400000, so that the process outlives this turn:
   `python rota/tools/handover.py standby --sid <your session id>`
   The harness kills a background command at the cap that
   `BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` in `.claude/settings.json` sets, one day, and at
   thirty minutes with no `timeout`. The watcher blocks 86000 seconds and
   exits 3 on its own, so a kill means the timeout was not passed.
   Do not pass a name. The hook enrolled your peer name already, and you
   cannot read that name before step 3.
3. Run `python rota/tools/handover.py peers` in the foreground. Find
   your own session id in the table. A background command returns at once
   and can still fail, so this step turns a hope into a fact. The name
   beside your session id is your peer name, and it is the address a
   message uses.
4. Reply with one line: your session id, the peer name the table printed,
   and the word standby. Then stop.

Read nothing else. Do not read the composition page, the stack, or any
file. Do not plan any work. Every token you spend now is a token the
frame you receive will not have.

If step 3 does not list you, say so and stop. Do not arm a second
watcher. A session that is not in the table is not in the reserve, and no
frame reaches it.

If a permission prompt appears at step 2, answer nothing and say so. A
prompt parks this session mid-turn, and a parked session receives
nothing at all. The Principal must add the rule to
`.claude/settings.json` first.

## When your watcher exits

The harness wakes you, because a background task that exits re-invokes
its session. Read the task output, and act on the exit code.

- **0**: a hand-off arrived. Run
  `python rota/tools/handover.py take --sid <your session id>`, then
  follow the wake procedure in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **3**: the wait ran out and nothing arrived. Arm the watcher again,
  exactly as in step 2, and stop.
- **6**: the claim is there and will not open. Run the take command again
  in a minute. Do not take other work, and do not report that no
  hand-off waits. A frame is addressed to you.
- **1**: your registration is gone, so you left the reserve. Do not arm
  again. Say so and stop.
- **2**: one of two things, and the output says which. You hold a frame
  already, so report which frame and stop. Or you read at or past 300k, so
  the command took your seat back. A session there takes no new frame, so
  it is handed none. Tell the Principal a window is needed, and do not arm
  again.

## If step 2 says a hand-off was already waiting

The reserve was empty when a peer handed off, so the frame waited on disk
for you. That is the drought case, and it is why the command looks before
it blocks. The watcher has already exited with 0. Take the frame now, and
then follow the wake procedure in `CLAUDE.md`.

## If you wake with no task output

The harness can end a background process without a word, and a machine
that sleeps ends every watcher on it. You are then a session that nobody
can reach, and neither you nor the Principal can see it. So on any wake
where you cannot find your watcher's output, run
`python rota/tools/handover.py peers` and look for your own row.

- Your row is there, and its beat is a number of seconds: the watcher
  lives. Stop.
- Your row says STALE, or no row names you: the watcher is gone. Arm it
  again from step 2, and tell the Principal that a watcher died.
