r"""
The hand-off, tested on the promises a session bets its frame on.

Four promises carry the whole tool, so each one gets a test that fails
loudly when it breaks:

* One claim wakes exactly one standby. The rest of the reserve keeps the
  clean context that made it worth handing to.
* Two senders that hand off in the same second take two different
  standbys. Never the same one.
* A sender never calls a hand-off done on its own write. It waits for the
  receiver's own state to say `holding`, and it exits 4 when that never
  comes.
* A standby that was claimed is never offered again, even before it takes
  the frame, and even though its watcher has stopped beating.

Timing is short on purpose. The module's poll interval is monkeypatched
down, so each test costs a fraction of a second instead of a full beat.
